2.0:
  - INCOMPATIBILITY: Possibly with scripts that modify the level up message

  - REMOVED Feature: USE_DIALOGUE_FILES flag
                     (Was quite meaningless, just don't use the \dialogue[] tag
                      if you don't need it :D)
  - Bugfix: Extraction no longer ignores Battle Events
  - Bugfix: Level up message is now displayed correctly after name change
  - New Feature: Now supports comment lines starting with '#' in the .rvtext files
  - New Feature: Checks the content of the files for validity and produces a log with
                 errors and warnings pointing to the invalid places.
  - New Feature: Added a new \dialogue![] tag (exclamation mark before brackets)
                 which uses the message options given in the dialogue file.
                 The normal \dialogue[] tag will no longer use them but use
                 those specified in RPG Maker.
  - Changed the property 'no_fast' of scrolling messages to 'scroll_no_fast'
    with a value of either true or false
