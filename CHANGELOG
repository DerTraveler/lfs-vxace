2.0:
  - REMOVED Feature: USE_DIALOGUE_FILES flag
                     (Was quite meaningless, just don't use the \dialogue[] tag
                      if you don't need it :D)
  - New Feature: Now supports comment lines starting with '#' in the .rvtext files
  - New Feature: Checks the content of the files for validity and produces a log with
                 errors and warnings pointing to the invalid places.
  - Changed the property 'no_fast' of scrolling messages to 'scroll_no_fast'
    with a value of either true or false
